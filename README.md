### Game
I made this as a fencing training tool because I was a varsity fencer in high school.
Because fencing gear is cumbersome and keeping the gear on you is difficult, practicing in VR is a quick way to get in target practice wherever you are (provided there is enough space).

The goal is to grab the sword in front of you, take a few quick [advances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_fencing "advances") forward and lunge into a target.

The targets have different points. In this case, the red gives the most points, blue gives fewer points, and hitting the wall in the back reduces your points.

Once you hit a target, you and the sword are teleported back to the starting point. If you accidentally drop the sword, you can reset the game by pressing (A).

I added a static wall at the base of the target wall to ensure that the user has to lunge into the target instead of just walking up to it.

Though this seems promising, there is still much to do. Primarily, the grabbing of the sword is not that accurate because fencers hold their swords in a very particular manner. Additionally, the blade of the sword should be very thin and almost flimsy so that fencers could flick towards their target as a strategy.
